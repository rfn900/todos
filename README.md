# Uppgift 1 - TODO application

This is course project for Backend 3.

I am using the [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com) application as a model for
my design.

## Requirements for _G_

- The application should be done with the `MERN` stack
- The user should be able to create multiple lists, add, edit and delete a given
  list
- A TODO list should have the following:
  - Heading (text)
  - Conte√∫do (text)
  - Date of the last edit (date)
- The application needs to show an overview of all lists as well as the details
  of single lists
- The code should be in a public repo on Github
- No pointless comments and no `console.log`, should be left in the final
  version of the code.

## Requirements for _VG_

- Everything listed in the requirements for _G_
- Authentication/login system (Email + Password or Google, Facebook, Github,
  etc.)
